# TODO: This test requires a dummy Rails app to be set up in the engine.
# The engine needs to be properly mounted and tested in isolation.
# For now, these tests are preserved here for future implementation.
#
# To properly test this engine:
# 1. Create a test/dummy Rails app within the engine
# 2. Set up test_helper.rb to load the dummy app
# 3. Mount the engine in the dummy app's routes
# 4. Run tests with: bin/rails test (from within the engine directory)

      # Adjust the paths based on where the engine is mounted in your dummy app
