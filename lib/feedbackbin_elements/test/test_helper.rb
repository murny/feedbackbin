# TODO: Set up proper test environment for the engine
#
# This test helper will need to:
# 1. Load a dummy Rails application for testing
# 2. Load the engine
# 3. Set up fixtures and test data
# 4. Configure any necessary test helpers
#
# Example structure:
# ENV["RAILS_ENV"] = "test"
# require_relative "dummy/config/environment"
# require "rails/test_help"
#
# For now, this file is a placeholder until the dummy app is created.

puts "WARNING: FeedbackbinElements tests require a dummy Rails app to be set up."
