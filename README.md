> While functional, it's not yet production-ready. Star the repo to follow along!

## Running Your Own Instance

If you want to run your own FeedbackBin instance without modifying the code, you
can use our pre-built Docker image. You'll need a server that can run Docker and
some configuration for your installation.

See our [Docker deployment guide](docs/docker-deployment.md) for details.

If you want more flexibility to customize FeedbackBin by changing its code and
deploying those changes, we recommend deploying with Kamal. See our
[Kamal deployment guide](docs/kamal-deployment.md) for a complete walkthrough.

## Development

You are welcome—and encouraged—to modify FeedbackBin to your liking.

See our [Development guide](docs/development.md) for how to get FeedbackBin set
up for local development.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please read our [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)
before submitting code.

## License

FeedbackBin is released under the [O'Saasy License](LICENSE.md).

This means you can use, modify, and distribute the software freely. The one
restriction: you can't use it to directly compete with FeedbackBin by offering
it as a hosted SaaS product.
